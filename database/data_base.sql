1. What do you understand By Database.
ans = A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).

2.What is Normalization?
ans = Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships. The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate redundant (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored logically.

3.What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
ans = In DBMS, the data is stored as a file, whereas in RDBMS, data is stored in the form of tables.

4.What is MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems?
 ans = This rule states that for a system to qualify as an RDBMS, it must be able to manage database entirely through the relational capabilities.
 
5.What do you understand By Data Redundancy?
 ans =  Data redundancy occurs when the same piece of data exists in multiple places, whereas data inconsistency is when the same data exists in different formats in multiple tables. Unfortunately, data redundancy can cause data inconsistency, which can provide a company with unreliable and/or meaningless information.
 
6.What is DDL Interpreter?
 ans = DL Interpreter DDL expands to Data Definition Language. DDL Interpreter as the name suggests interprets the DDL statements such as schema definition statements like create, delete, etc
 
7. What is DML Compiler in SQL?
 ans = A DML (data manipulation language) refers to a computer programming language that allows you to add (insert), delete (delete), and alter (update) data in a database.
 
 8.What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints
 ans = SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table.
 
 9.What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query?
 ans = A save point is a logical rollback point within a transaction. When you set a save point, whenever an error occurs past a save point, you can undo the events you have done up to the save point using the rollback.
 
 10.What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?
 ans = A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server.
